Welcome to my Github. 



*Standard Disclaimer*
I am not the type of person to chase large numbers of commits, or other "mainstream" statistics. 
If you take a glance at some of my commits on personal projects, you may notice that my pushes are unusually large. 
This is largely due to the robust testing that Vercel allows me, and I make use of it constantly.

##Please be aware that most of my projects are private/in-progress. For what is available, I hope you enjoy making use of it!
